TRACK-COVID study: a population-based epidemiological investigation of COVID-19 virus infection 

Using a group of healthy blood donors, the TRACK-COVID study was set up at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic to try to understand the spread of the new coronavirus. Using the TRACK-COVID study questionnaire data, antibody results and linked health record data, we will be able to address the two questions a) the spread of the virus during the pandemic and b) how long antibodies from vaccines remain in our bodies. Having access to the linked health records for this study will provide important information on accurate vaccine dates, infection dates and any serious illness that required hospitalisation, if reported to the NHS. It will also help us address reinfection rates of the virus following a natural infection or vaccine. We will look at information on all vaccines combined as well as each type of vaccine individually. 
The results from this study will provide policy makers in government with vital information on what happened during the peak of the pandemic (mainly the spread of the virus and who was most at risk). It will also help to address the question of how often vaccines are required. Together, this information will be extremely beneficial for the general population.
